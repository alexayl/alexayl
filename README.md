I'm a Computer Engineering student at Purdue focused on embedded systems and low-level software development.

I’m currently working on:
- A HIL system for a drone flight controller
- A robot that can take an uploaded image and draw it on the whiteboard

I’m currently studying:
- Operating systems
- Compilers
- Embedded software design

👯 I’m looking to add more embedded projects to ES@P. If you are Purdue-affiliated, working on something cool, and want help with funding, workspace, and mentorship, reach out on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexayl).
