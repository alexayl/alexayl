I'm a Computer Engineering student at Purdue focused on embedded systems and low-level software development.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Building Zephyr applications for embedded projects
- A CI-enabled HIL System for [ES@P](https://embedded-purdue.github.io)'s projects involving complex DUTs
- Senior design project (coming soon)
- Git, Embedded C++, and Zephyr workshops for ES@P

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Zephyr RTOS
- Operating systems and compilers

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to add more embedded projects to ES@P. If you are Purdue-affiliated, working on something cool, and want help with funding, workspace, and mentorship, reach out on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexayl).
